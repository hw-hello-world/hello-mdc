* POC

** fix the build problem

   1. [X] webpack server
   2. [X] build demo css
   3. [X] what is ~publicPath~? A directory (in-memory) that serve
      static assets.

** Button

   - Extends material component
   - [X] ~a~ button cannot be disabled. Disabling is done via
     ~button.disabled~ property where ~a~ doesn't have. Maybe it's
     semantically incorrect to /disable/ a link?

** icon

   1. easily integrated.
   2. probably could keep using the existing icon styles unless we like
      new approach. (ligatures)
   3. will ligatures possibly simplify use case?
   4. Ligatures :: which allows rendering of an icon glyph simply by using its textual name.

** TODO Tabs

** TODO Theme

   - understand the css structure for theme
   - how to add a theme

** Dialog

   + style of courage modal is actually more coming from form.
   + modal itself has few styles.
   + customized to FormDialog

** Form

  + need more thoughts

** Callout

   + demo migrating to a customized component.
   + [X] implement the dismiss-able callout
   + Improvement: can icon hardly depend on the top style hence dont need to declare icon?
