* POC

  - [X] fix the build problem
    1. [X] webpack server
    2. [X] build demo css
    3. [X] what is ~publicPath~? A directory (in-memory) that serve
       static assets.

  - Button
    - Extends material component
    - [X] ~a~ button cannot be disabled. Disabling is done via
      ~button.disabled~ property where ~a~ doesn't have. Maybe it's
      semantically incorrect to /disable/ a link?

  - [X] icon
    1. easily integrated.
    2. probably could keep using the existing icon styles unless we like
       new approach. (ligatures)
    3. will ligatures possibly simplify use case?
    4. Ligatures :: which allows rendering of an icon glyph simply by using its textual name.

  - [ ] Tabs

  - [ ] Dialog

  - [ ] Form field

  - Callout
    + demo migrating to a customized component.
    + [ ] implement the dismiss-able callout
    + [ ] can icon hardly depend on the top style hence dont need to declare icon?
